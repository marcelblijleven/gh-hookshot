## Motivation

I work on applications that rely heavily on GitHub webhooks across hundreds of
repositories, so I wanted a fast, visual, and developer-friendly way to interact
with webhooks right inside my terminal.

My main use cases are:

* Quickly inspecting webhook deliveries without leaving the terminal
* Debugging failing hooks faster, copying payloads easily without opening the browser (upcoming feature)
* Redelivering hooks when necessary (upcoming feature)

## Quickstart

Available flags:

* `--owner` ‚Äî repository owner (required)
* `--repo` ‚Äî repository name (required)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You‚Äôll need admin permission on the target repo to view webhooks and deliveries; otherwise the UI will show a clear error.

### Keybindings

* Move: `‚Üë/k` `‚Üì/j` `‚Üê/h` `‚Üí/l`
* Select: `Enter`
* Toggle Help: `?`
* Quit: `q` `esc` `ctrl+c`

## Features

* **List webhooks** configured on a repository
* **Browse deliveries** per webhook (including redeliveries)
* **View delivery details** (JSON request/response rendered nicely in the terminal)

### Upcoming features

* [ ] Redeliver deliveries
* [ ] Copy delivery content to clipboard
* [ ] Layout improvements
* [ ] Determine owner/repo based on active git directory

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hookshot requires the official [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) to be installed and authenticated.
